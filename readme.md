## Documentation

Visit the [Aragon Developer Portal](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/apm-intro.html) for in-depth documentation on the [architecture](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/apm-architecture) and different parts of the system.

## Developing aragonPM locally

```sh
npm install
npm test

# Lint needs to pass as well
npm run lint
```

## Deploying

```sh
OWNER=[APM owner address] ENS=[ENS registry address] npx truffle exec --network [network] scripts/deploy-apm.js
```

- `ENS`: If no ENS registry address is provided, it will deploy a dummy ENS instance to the network. If the ENS registry is provided, the name `aragonpm.eth` must be owned by the deployer account.
- `OWNER`: The account that will be the initial owner of the APM registry
